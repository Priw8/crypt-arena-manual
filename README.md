## NOTE: this manual was made at the time when Synchrony was unofficial, and Crypt Arena was just a mod; with the Synchrony DLC now released, Crypt Arena is bundled as Versus mode. This repo is still kept for historical reasons (I don't like deleting things), but the manual itself has not been updated to reflect Synchrony DLC Versus mode.
